# SalesTrackerCS210

# Sales tracker program with C++ and Python

# Summary
This program opens to a menu with C++ with 4 options:
  1: check all sales
  2: check sales of a specific item
  3: create a histogram of all sales
  4: exit program
Option 1 calls Python function to display each item sold and the number of times that item has sold
option 2 asks for which item you would like to check, calls python with item as string parameter and returns how many times that item has sold
  if the item is not listed, it tells you item has not yet sold
option 3 calls python function to create a .dat file which will be read in C++ to display a histogram of all items sold

Journal:

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel as though I did a good job reading inut from the file and iterating though the data to display the results properly thoughout the project.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
